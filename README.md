# Toku App

## Overview

This is a simple Japanese language learning app developed using Flutter. The application allows users to learn the basics of the Japanese language, such as (numbers - colors - family members - some famous sentences), and this is done by reading the word in English, knowing its Japanese translation, and also hearing the pronunciation of this word in Japanese.
